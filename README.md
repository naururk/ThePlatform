A social game where every step determines your fate. Choose your strategy, manage risk, claim your reward. A social experiment about greed, risk, and trust. Deposit ETH → make a blind choice (GRAB / SKIM / HOLD) → watch the tower resolve floor by floor. You start on one of 50 floors. Your goal: decide whether to risk, play it safe, or wait for the finale. Choices and deposits stay private during registration thanks to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on FHEVM, and are revealed for result computation only once the session starts or finishes.

## Concept

* **FHE‑encrypted game mechanics** on Sepolia using an FHEVM‑compatible contract.
* Players join a **season**, deposit ETH, and pick a hidden action. Floors (1..50) are assigned randomly and the platform resolves from floor **1 → 50**.
* The twist: during **WAITING** (registration) players’ **deposit** and **choice** are encrypted on‑chain. They become publicly decryptable for result calculation only after the session transitions to **RUNNING/DONE**.

This is *intentionally* a **game / social experiment**—testing patience vs. greed under partial information.

---

## How winnings are calculated

### Lifecycle

1. **WAITING** — registration is open. Players call `join(nick, encDeposit, encChoice, proof)` and send ETH. Data is encrypted via Relayer SDK and stored as FHE handles.
2. **RUNNING** — owner starts the session. Floors are randomly assigned and materialized. Encrypted values become publicly decryptable for off‑chain processing.
3. **DONE** — results are computed off‑chain and **published on‑chain** via `publishResults(...)` (or `PayoutsPublished`/`ResultsPublished` events).

### Success windows

* There are **50 floors**. Each floor has a chance window for **GRAB** and **SKIM**:

  * **Initial windows:** **GRAB ≤ 26**, **SKIM ≤ 50** (expressed as half‑steps on‑chain).
  * **After each successful event:**

    * successful **GRAB** → **both** windows decrease by **1.0** floor
    * successful **SKIM** → **both** windows decrease by **0.5** floor

### Payout math

Let `deposit` be a player’s deposit.

* **GRAB** (if within GRAB window): gross = `3 × deposit` (capped by current pool).
* **SKIM** (if within SKIM window): gross = `1.25 × deposit` (capped by current pool).
* **HOLD**: after floor 50, if any pool **remainder** exists, it is split **pro‑rata** among HOLD deposits. If no remainder, no HOLD payouts.

**Fees & carry:** From the season’s **base** (sum of this season’s deposits + **carried-in** from previous season) the contract takes **2%** upfront:

* **1%** to **Treasury** (accumulates across seasons, owner‑claimable)
* **1%** to **Next pool** (seed for the next season)
* The remaining **98%** is the **net pool** used for payouts in this season.

**Carry between seasons:** At `startNextSeason` the contract moves `nextPoolPublic + remainderToCarryPublic` to the new season as `carriedInPublic`.

## Interface & usage

### Landing

* Connect your wallet (MetaMask or any EVM wallet). The dApp enforces **Sepolia**.
* If not on Sepolia, the app requests a network switch.

### Top bar

* Shows app name, network, short contract address.
* Buttons: **Seasons History**, **Profile** (enabled once nick is set), **Connect/Disconnect**.

### Right panel — Registration & Rewards

* **Status badges**: Season ID, Status (WAITING/RUNNING/DONE), Players count, Pool (net 98%).
* **Nickname** input (required to enable Profile).
* **Deposit (ETH)** input.
* **Choice** buttons: GRAB / SKIM / HOLD.
* **Join** (enabled only in WAITING, when nick/deposit/choice are valid). Joining encrypts your deposit & choice via Relayer SDK and submits on‑chain.
* **Your rewards (accumulated)** + **Claim** button to withdraw your unclaimed payouts across seasons.

### Left panel — Visualization & Results

* While a season is **DONE**, you can open the **Platform visualization**: a tower animation reveals each floor (1..50) with nick/choice/payout once results are available.
* The **Results table** lists Floor, Nick, Deposit, Choice, Payout, Address. Your row is highlighted.

<img width="589" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c11b4c22-aaa5-4525-be59-ba36c55e31d7" /> <img width="582" height="558" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0c6bb61-bbf0-474c-9e04-e4a2b14700ea" />

### Profile

* Personal summary: **Nick**, **Address**, **Total rewards**.
* **Season history** for your address (previous seasons only), with a table of:

  * Season, Floor, Deposit, Choice, Reward.
* **Pagination:** **10 rows per page** (like in Seasons History).

### Seasons History

* Season picker shows all **past** seasons (excludes current) with **pagination: 10 seasons per page**.
* “View results” opens the Results table for that season.
* Above the table, a compact **Pool / Treasury / Next pool** summary (based on deposits + carried‑in minus 2%).

### Admin panel

> Visible only to the **owner**.

* **Run session → RUNNING**: assigns floors and opens decryptability for off‑chain processing.
* **Compute & publish results**: the dApp decrypts public FHE handles via the Relayer, computes payouts off‑chain, and calls `publishResults(...)`.
* **Treasury**: view accumulated 1% and **Claim Treasury**.
* **Start next season (WAITING)**: closes the old season, carries `nextPool + remainder` into the new season and resets state.

## Architecture

**High‑level flow:**

1. **Frontend (SPA, ES Modules)** collects inputs and encrypts them with **Zama Relayer SDK** → submits FHE handles to the contract via `join(...)`.
2. **Smart contract (FHEVM‑compatible)** stores encrypted handles during **WAITING** and exposes public getters for decryption after **RUNNING** begins.
3. **Relayer** provides:

   * `createEncryptedInput(...)` for client‑side encryption
   * `publicDecrypt(...)` (and `userDecrypt` fallback) once the session allows it
4. **Off‑chain compute** (inside Admin panel) aggregates deposits, applies **success window** rules and payout math, then calls `publishResults(...)` with per‑player deposits/choices/payouts plus global **treasury / next pool / remainder**.
5. **On‑chain state** becomes the single source of truth for **claims** and **history**.

**Data privacy model:** deposits & choices are hidden during **WAITING**; only FHE handles are on‑chain. Clear values are revealed for computation **after** RUNNING/DONE via public decrypt.

---

## Tech stack

* **Solidity / FHEVM‑compatible contract**
* **Zama Relayer SDK** (browser, CDN) for client‑side FHE encryption & public decrypt
* **Ethers v6** for RPC, events, and publishing results
* **Pure ES Modules** (no build step), React 18 (via ESM) for UI
* **MetaMask / EVM wallets** on **Sepolia**

---

## Why FHE

* **Private commitments**: deposits and choices remain confidential during registration, preventing copy‑cat or sniping strategies.
* **Fair resolution**: only after the session starts, the game reveals clear values to compute payouts.
* **On‑chain verifiability**: final results (including per‑player payouts and global accounting) are published on‑chain.

## Configuration

All key settings live in **`public/js/config.js`**:

```js
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x9010265316777018900556E6BE523786733f2bf2"; // ← set your deployed contract
export const CHAIN_ID        = 11155111n;  // Sepolia (BigInt)
export const CHAIN_ID_HEX    = "0xaa36a7";
export const RELAYER_URL     = "https://relayer.testnet.zama.org";
export const GATEWAY_URL     = "https://gateway.testnet.zama.org";
```

* **CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: your deployed `ThePlatformFHE` address on Sepolia.
* **RELAYER_URL / GATEWAY_URL**: Zama relayer endpoints. `relayer.js` tries multiple CDNs and a local fallback.
* Optionally you can override these via `window.__APP_CONFIG__` **before** the app mounts (e.g. injected by your hosting). If you don’t need runtime overrides, keep `config.js` as is.

## Run locally

No bundler. The app uses native browser ES modules.

1. Serve the `public/` folder with any static server (CORS‑friendly):

   ```bash
   npx http-server public -p 5173 --cors
   # or python3 -m http.server 5173 --directory public
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Have **MetaMask** installed and switch to **Sepolia**.
4. Connect wallet, set a nickname, enter a deposit, choose **GRAB/SKIM/HOLD**, and **Join** while status is **WAITING**.

> Owner‑only: use **Admin panel** to start the session, compute & publish results, claim treasury, and start the next season.

---

## Security & privacy notes

* During **WAITING**, deposits and choices are stored as **FHE ciphertext handles**. The app uses Zama’s **Relayer SDK** to encrypt inputs and later decrypt **publicly** once the session allows it.
* Off‑chain computation is transparent: results are published on‑chain via `publishResults(...)` with per‑player deposit, choice code, and payout, plus global **treasury / next pool / remainder** fields.
* Claims use `claimUnclaimed()` (aggregate) or `claim(sessionId, amount)`.

---

## Limitations / known issues

* The visualization (tower) is a UI layer; it does not influence payouts.
* Public decrypt availability depends on Relayer configuration; in restricted setups, an owner may need user‑authorized decrypt for some handles.
* Gas/provider rate limits can affect log scans (chunked queries are implemented to mitigate).

---

## Judging checklist

* **Deployed & working** on Sepolia (connect, join with encrypted inputs, compute & publish results, claim).
* **Clear FHE story**: encrypted inputs during WAITING, public decrypt only after RUNNING/DONE, on‑chain publishing of final results.
* **Innovation & gameplay**: success‑window mechanic with dynamic shrink (GRAB −1.0, SKIM −0.5) and three strategies (GRAB/SKIM/HOLD).
* **UX & performance**: no‑build SPA, responsive UI, results table & history with pagination, profile view.
* **Security & transparency**: auditable on‑chain outputs; treasury/next‑pool/remainder accounting; claimable rewards.
* **Documentation**: this README explains rules, architecture, tech stack, setup, and review steps.
* **Reproducibility**: run locally with a static server; config is in a single file.

> Reviewer quick‑path: open app → connect MetaMask on Sepolia → set nick + deposit + choice → join (WAITING) → owner starts RUNNING → compute & publish → check results/history → claim rewards.
